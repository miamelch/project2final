	<h1>Inside the World of Bumble</h1>
	<p class="p1"> Bumble is a website that is based around women making the first moves and helping people live positive and productive lifestyles. Whitney Wolfe is the Bumble Founder and CEO whose goal was to empower women and give them the choice to make the first move. Bumble is tailored around people looking for a commited and supportive relationship. The Bumble website reads "in the era of constant communication, consumption, and connectivity, our users are telling us loud and clear they're completely burned out on bad relationships." Bumble is a clear example of how the internet is changing relationship norms and leading to a more equal future. Click below to see how Bumble is making women everywhere to make the first move.</p>
