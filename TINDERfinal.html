	<p class="p1">Tinder is an app that allows user to like or dislike profiles based on a small bio and common interests. The app was one of the first dating apps to exist and served to connect people through their contacts and Facebook. In 2014, the app reached it's peak of one billion "swipes" per day. To increase the chance of a right swipe, users can upload several pictures and include a bio that reflects one's personality.
