<p class="p2">MEET KETHMI AND JON!</p>
	<p class="p2">Their conversation started immediately and lasted 4 hours straight.They decided to get dinner and both could not wait! Jon though Kethmi was beautiful, witty, and laughed at every joke the whole time! Unfortunately, at the end of the date Kethmi explains "Your going to hate me. We should just be friends." So, Jon dissapointed decides to move on with his life until the next day he receives a text from Kethmi. Jon explains to her sorry I am looking for a commited relationship not someone who will be flaky. The next day her "friend" went to her house and claimed Kethmi to be missing. Jon explains to her friend we must call the cops. Instead, Kethmi shows up and claims "Jon you really care about me!" The next day, Jon goes to work and comes back to his phone after lunch to 115 new texts and 48 missed calls. Jon claims this needs to end. When he drove home from work, he realized Kethmi was behind him. Luckily, Jon was able to lose her and havent heard from her since. Moral of the story: love can't always be found from an algorithm:( </p>
